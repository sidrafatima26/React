# State Lifting with Callbacks in React
This repository exemplifies the state lifting pattern in React, leveraging callback functions. State lifting involves managing state in a higher-level or parent component and passing it down to child components. Callback functions empower child components to interact with and modify the state of the parent component.

## Implementation
In this example, the ParentComponent maintains a count state using the useState hook. It defines a callback function, handleIncrement, which is then passed down to the ChildComponent as a prop. The child component can invoke this callback function to trigger an update to the count in the parent component.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/state-lifting-callback.git`

`cd state-lifting-callback`

`npm start`

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to witness the state lifting example with a callback function in action.

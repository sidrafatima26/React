# React Router App

Welcome to the React Router App! This project is a React application that utilizes React Router for navigation and routing between different components.

## Overview

The React Router App demonstrates the implementation of client-side routing in a React application. It uses the React Router library to enable navigation between different views without the need for a full page reload.

## Features

- **Routing:** Utilize React Router to enable navigation between different components.
- **Dynamic Routing:** Implement dynamic routing for handling parameters in the URL.
- **Nested Routes:** Showcase nested routes for organizing complex user interfaces.

## How to Run

Follow these steps to run the React Router App locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/React-Router.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

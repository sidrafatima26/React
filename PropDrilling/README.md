# React Prop Drilling Example

Welcome to the React Prop Drilling Example repository! This project illustrates the concept of prop drilling in React, showcasing the flow of data from a parent component through a child component to a grandchild component.

## Overview

In this React application, I created a parent component (`ParentComponent`), a child component (`ChildComponent`), and a grandchild component (`GrandchildComponent`). Prop drilling is employed to pass data from the parent down to the grandchild through the child component.

## Components

### 1. ParentComponent

The top-level component that holds the initial data to be passed down the component hierarchy.

### 2. ChildComponent

Receives data from `ParentComponent` through props and passes it down to `GrandchildComponent`.

### 3. GrandchildComponent

Receives data from `ChildComponent` through props and utilizes it within its own component logic.

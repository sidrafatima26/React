# React Counter App with useState Hook

Welcome to the React Counter App repository! This project demonstrates the use of the `useState` hook to create a basic counter application in React.

## Overview

The React Counter App showcases the fundamental use of the `useState` hook, a React feature that allows functional components to manage state. In this application, we've implemented a simple counter with increment and decrement functionality.

## Features

- **Counter Display:** View the current count on the screen.
- **Increment:** Increase the count with a click on the "Increment" button.
- **Decrement:** Decrease the count with a click on the "Decrement" button.
